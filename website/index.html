                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As well as being a Founders and Coders applicant, I am a teacher, musician, DJ and proud cat owner.</p>

                <p>I moved to London in 2010 to study Music and completed undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in composition and electronic music. I continue to be an active musician and DJ, recently receiving radio play on Radio 1 and hosting my own shows on London community radio stations. I am especially passionate about a style of music called amapiano, the subject of my hobby page project.</p>

                <p>After leaving university, I spent some time working at an EdTech start-up. This was truly a formative experience, as it has since inspired me to seek opportunities in both the education and tech spaces. I have spent the last 6 years working in London primary schools, completing my teacher training in 2019. I love the buzz of working in the classroom and have many memories from my time as a teacher which will stay with me forever. Teaching has also taught me how to break down complex concepts into their core components, a skill that I have found essential when solving coding problems</p>
                <p>In my free time, I love cooking and looking after my cat Musuko ('son' in Japanese). I have a strong interest in current affairs, politics and social issues and like to keep up to date with the latest news and commentary. My big hope for the future is to travel more, which has been especially difficult for the last few years! Next on my bucket list are Naples, Istanbul and Accra.</p>
